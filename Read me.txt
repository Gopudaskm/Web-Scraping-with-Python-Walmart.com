# Find_Seller_Info.py

## Description
"Find_Seller_Info.py" is a Python script that extracts seller information of laptops from "https://www.walmart.com/" website. 
The program first extracts product id and title of the products and saves them to a dictionary file with product id as key and title as value. 
Then it extracts seller information for the products using the product ids and updates the dictionary with the seller information.
